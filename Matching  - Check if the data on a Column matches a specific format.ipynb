    "When creating regular expressions for OnCommand Insight automatic resolution, you can configure output format by entering values in a field named FORMAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default setting is \\1, which means that a zone name that matches the regular expression is replaced by the contents of the first variable created by the regular expression. In a regular expression, variable values are created by parenthetical statements. If multiple parenthetical statements occur, the variables are referenced numerically, from left to right. The variables can be used in the output format in any order. Constant text can also be inserted in the output, by adding it to the FORMAT field.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might have the following zone names for this zone naming convention:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Zone number]_[data center]_[hostname]_[device type]_[interface number]\n",
    "S123_Miami_hostname1_filer_FC1\n",

    "S3991_Boston_hostname3_windows2K_FC0\n",

    "And you might want the output to be in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "[hostname]-[data center]-[device type]\n",
    "To do this, you need to capture the host name, data center, and device type fields in variables, and use them in the output. The following regular expression would do this:\n",
    "\n",
    ".*?_([a-zA-Z0-9]+)_([a-zA-Z0-9]+)_([a-zA-Z0-9]+)_.*\n",
    "Because there are three sets of parentheses, the variables \\1, \\2 and \\3 would be populated.\n",

    "The _ (underscore) means that the digits after S must be followed immediately by only an underscore character in the zone name. In this example, the zone naming convention uses the underscore to separate the zone name from the host name.\n",
    "After the required underscore, the parentheses indicate that the pattern contained within will be stored in the \\1 variable.\n",
    "The bracketed characters [a-zA-Z0-9] indicate that the characters being matched are all letters (regardless of case) and numbers.\n",
